scripts
=======

Collection of JC2-MP scripts packaged with the official server software

## Getting Started

* Clone the repo: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/jc2mp/scripts.git`
* Update the submodules: `git submodule foreach "(git checkout master; git pull)"`
  
If you already have the repo cloned, you will only need to run the second step to update the submodules.
